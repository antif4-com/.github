**antif4.com** is a sincere, human-focused, online community. We are building safe, durable online communities that deeply value diversity and are mutually supportive. 

The world is not safe, and so we must make our own safe harbors. We are doing this taking back ownership of our personal online lives and creating a safe space for people to turn to for safety and support.

Right now, we are focused on building the technical infrastructure of antif4.com. In addition, we are in closed, alpha testing of our intial email service.
